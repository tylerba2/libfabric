.SH NAME
fi_qdma_tcp \- libfabric qdma_tcp provider (experimental)
.SH OVERVIEW
The qdma_tcp provider is an experimental provider that layers a QDMA-based
fast-path over the libfabric TCP provider.

This provider is intended for development and experimentation.

.SH NOTES
This provider currently depends on internal symbols from the tcp provider and
is therefore built-in (not as a dlopen plugin).
